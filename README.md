# MINI TASK #1: DVD logo

Do you feel nostolgic about 00s? If yes, then this repository is for you!
Do you remember times when DVD player under TV was a must? Time has changed. DVD players have become extinct, but for one last time you can become Marty McFly (that dude from "Back to the future" movies) and witness legendary DVD logo hiting the corner!
